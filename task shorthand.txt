1. Design and execute experiments to evaluate PRSH
Analyse how k changes behaviour
Analyse how changing mutation function changes behaviour for set k


2. Extend PRSH - optional
Improve the hill climb, gradient descent?


Notes on both:
- design appropriate experiments 
- informative visualisations
- appropriate statistical tests

PRSH description:
PRSH = adpative PRZI
PRZI s parameter = strategy, can behave like SHVR, ZIC, GVWY (-1 <= s <= 1)
Adjusts this by simple, inefficient, stochastic hill climb
PRSH k parameter = number of different s's tried on each pass
PRSH mutation function = applied to s which made most profit, gives similar, mutated values of s for next pass

Statistical testing notes:
Simplifying assumptions - IBMs one-in-many vs balanced-group
Stochastic so need to ensure sufficient evidence - multiple sesions
Supply and demand schedules - static? IBM mostly static, pairwise comparisons

Extending PRSH notes:
Multi-armed bandits
Gradient descent? 

Metrics for comparison:
- profit
- profit per second
- profit per trade
- margin (profit as percentage of limit)
